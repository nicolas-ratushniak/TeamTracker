# SportsTeam WPF app using MVVM pattern and text-based DB

During the course project a "Sports Team" database management system was developed for computers running the Windows operating system. Text files serve as the data storage.
The software is designed for users who are proficient in English. Special computer training is not mandatory.
Application Area: Software for laptops or personal computers with the Windows operating system installed. The project was developed in the C# programming language, using the Rider integrated development environment, and incorporating the WPF graphical subsystem. The MVVM architectural pattern was selected, a common and efficient approach for developing user interfaces in WPF applications. During the development a Git version control system was used. The project also incorporated third-party libraries to configure structured logging and program hosting with a DI container.
The functionality of this project can be expanded in the future. Modifications to data processing logic and storage methods are also possible.
